# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"

  station_name: "Going to the station"
  station_desc: "he first stage is the way from home to the station, which is usually in the morning. This section is usually sunny and offers wonderful views at sunrise. Various houses are visible, but the people themselves are not really visible yet - except on the platform. It is morning on the road, so there is usually a little tiredness, sometimes you even have to hurry. Although it should be mentioned that the morning is represented here, as it is now - around summer time. Of course, in winter it is not as bright with yellow tones as represented in this illustration. You can also see houses and trees while walking to the station, so they were added in this excerpt. Emotions associated with this stage are usually: motivation to start the day, and maybe I tend to feel a bit tired."
  at_station: "Train station"
  at_station_desc: "The next leg on this road is the train station, which I rendered similarly to the first road leg, but with more yellow, which I also associate with this road leg. You can also see light colors, and the train station itself is in these light tones, which, with the morning breeze and brightness, reminds of this same motivation to start the day. This part of the day is also associated with the morning itself and similar feelings, which are on the way to the station, because after all, only 10 minutes have passed! Although sometimes it feels like it's taking less time, but that's usually when you're late. Waiting for the train is often boring, because there is usually little new to see here."
  ride: "Riding the train"
  ride_desc: "It takes relatively little time to travel from Olaine to Riga, which is about 25 km. In the meantime, I can relax and look out the window. Although in autumn and winter the view out of the window is not usually the most beautiful, in spring and summer it tends to be most of the time. Therefore, colors associated with spring and summer are also used here. It is at this time that I most want to look out the window and maybe listen to music while watching the scene through the window. Of course, another obstacle to this is the fact that there are quite a lot of people, and this also depends on the train, or rather, its departure time. And this aspect also affects the emotions of the trip quite a bit, because a full train often means standing, and then the experience may not be so cozy. Unfortunately, this is also one of those views where a little lack of time to supplement."
  garden: "Vermanes garden"
  garden_desc: "As well as, of course, you also get to pass by Vermanes garden. It takes a little longer to get to this stage, but you always pass by this place, if you don't mention individual cases. When walking past Vermanes garden, you always meet many people and it is always a very lively and lively place where something happens. Not infrequently, around this time, there are also some events and activities that are also held in this place. Passing by this place, it is always good to feel some greenery and a speck of nature in the center of Riga. But with the next stop, you will probably see or encounter a little more during the journey..."
  museum: "National History Museum of Latvia"
  museum_desc: "On the way to the University of Latvia, I often pass by the Nature Museum, which I also used to visit. I have been to this museum many times, the most this museum reminds me of my high school experience, because then most of the time we used to go on excursions with the class, which were part of the learning material prescribed for our field of study. Personally, I think this scene is pretty well done, but the only comment from me as the author would be about the pavement, which I think could have done better, and also the tram tracks could have been made more prominent, but overall I think this scene is pretty well done. Walking past the Natural History Museum, it's always a little strange to see a very, very small part of the museum when you've been there so many times and know how much room there really is."
  uni: "University of Latvia"
  uni_desc: "Also, we finally arrive at the University of Latvia, which is also the final stage of the road. This stage is usually the last, and the most emotions tend to figure in this stage. If you have to rush, then of course it is not a pleasant feeling, because usually I want to be very on time. However, if there is no need to hurry, then the cool peace can even meet some fellow students and discuss with them. Often this view is also usually quite beautiful, so I don't even really want to rush at this point on the road."
